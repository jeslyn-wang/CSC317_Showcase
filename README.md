- Student number: 1007915838
- Assignment augmented: A2

## Instructions
1. In src directory, run 'python3 generate_scene.py' to make JSON file with pikachu and eevee!
2. cd into build directory and run:
   'cmake ..'
   'make'
   './raytracing'
3. Look at generated rbg.ppm in the build folder - it will be a beautiful scene depicting pikachu and eevee having a wonderful time together with a nice tree in the background for nature (#scenery #aesthetic #motivational)

## Acknowledgements
- I followed the structure of the previously implemented code in A2 mostly to create this piece. So I'd like to acknowledge the teaching team for setting it up. 
- I would like to acknowledge Atsuko Nishida for the initial concept of Pikachu and Motofumi Fujiwara for the initial concept of Eevee. I would also like to acknowledge Ken Sugimori for finalizing the designs and Satoshi Tajiri for creating Pokemon.
