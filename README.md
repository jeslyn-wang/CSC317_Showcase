# Pikachu and Eevee's Wonderful Day Touching Grass

## Personal Information
- Full Name: Jeslyn Wang
- UtorID: wangjesl
- Student number: 1007915838
- Assignment augmented: A2

## Instructions
1. In src directory, run 'python3 generate_scene.py' to make JSON file with pikachu and eevee!
2. cd into build directory and run:
   'cmake ..'
   'make'
   './raytracing'
3. Look at generated rbg.ppm in the build folder - it will be a beautiful scene depicting pikachu and eevee having a wonderful time together with a nice tree in the background for nature (#scenery #aesthetic #motivational)

## Description
List of features added and code locations:
- Feature: Python file to easily add objects, materials and lights and generate JSON file for rendering. Location: src/generate_scene.py
- Feature: New materials for different colours in the scene. Location: in python file src/generate_scene.py
- Feature: Joy and happiness in the form of two cute pokemon in nature. Location: in our hearts (also as an output in rgb.ppm)

Notes:
- It took a lot of time and engineering estimation (guess & checking) to put everything in the right places. Thankfully the pure positivity emanating from these two beloved pokemon pulled me through. Thanks Pikachu and Eevee. 

## Acknowledgements
- I followed the structure of the previously implemented code in A2 mostly to create this piece. So I'd like to acknowledge the teaching team for setting it up. 
- I would like to acknowledge Atsuko Nishida for the initial concept of Pikachu and Motofumi Fujiwara for the initial concept of Eevee. I would also like to acknowledge Ken Sugimori for finalizing the designs and Satoshi Tajiri for creating Pokemon.
